              Hi! I'm Liz. I have a stupid haircut and I write speculative fiction about young women who make questionable decisions.
              I like books where romance takes a back seat, or just stays home.
              I enjoy creative world-building, humor, and characters who are nearly irredeemable. 
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              I live on a sailboat with my boyfriend and my dog. We're on a mission to sail around
              the world! I strive to incorporate my sailing experiences into my writing while
              being sensitive to the people who occupy the places we travel to.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              When I'm not writing about the impending apocalypse, I code or write about code.
              You can also sometimes find me doing yoga, walking with my dog, singing, or watching Taskmaster.
            </p>
            <h3 className={styles.textFooter}> âš“ Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
