              Hi! I'm Liz. I have a stupid haircut and I write speculative fiction about
              young women who make questionable decisions. I live on a sailboat with my boyfriend and my dog.
              We're on a mission to sail around the world!
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              I write what I know.
              I write about sailing because it helps me process my experiences.
              I also love incorporating the incredible, beautiful, fascinating places and people we encounter into my work.
              I write about pirates because...well, pirates. Duh.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              I write about characters who struggle with addiction and mental health because these are things I have struggled with.
              I write about the immigrant experience because I'm an immigrant.
              I write about climate change, pandemics, and the apocalypse because...honestly? It's more fun to read about those things in a book 
              than to watching them happening all around you.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              When I'm not writing about young adults and the impending apocalypse, I code or write about code.
              You can also sometimes find me doing yoga, walking my dog, singing, or watching Taskmaster.
            </p>
            <h3 className={styles.textFooter}> âš“ Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
