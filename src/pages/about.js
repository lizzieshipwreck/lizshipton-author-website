              Hi! I'm Liz. I write speculative fiction about women with problems.
              I'm a big fan of neurodivergence and diverse sexualities. I like books where romance takes a back seat,
              or just stays home. I enjoy self-deprecating humor, and characters who are nearly irredeemable.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              I live on a 43ft sailboat with my partner and my dog. We're on a mission to sail around
              the world! I strive to incorporate my sailing experiences into my writing while
              being sensitive to the people who occupy the places we travel to.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.text}>
              When I'm not writing about the impending apocalypse, I code or write about code.
              You can also sometimes find me doing yoga, walking with my dog, singing, or eating tacos.
            </p>
            <h3 className={styles.textFooter}>âš“ Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
