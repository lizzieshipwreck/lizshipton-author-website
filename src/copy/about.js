export const about_one = "Hi! I'm Liz. I'm a digital nomad, freelance writer, and indie author. I'm sailing around the world with my boyfriend and my dog, working as a content writer, and turning my real-life adventures into YA Sci-Fi books.";

export const about_two = "My debut fiction series, Thalassic, is based on my own experience sailing from California to Panama. It's about two friends who are forced to sail across a dangerous ocean in a post-apocalyptic, high-tech dystopia. Along the way, they fight pirates, rescue a dog, run from a shadow government, overcome mental health issues, and (of course) fall in love ❤️"

export const about_three = "I love incorporating the incredible experiences, beautiful places, and fascinating people I encounter on my travels into my work. So many parts of the world are underrepresented in fiction, particularly speculative fiction. In addition to exploring the world in my writing, I like to explore themes surrounding mental health, addiction, technology, and climate change."

export const about_four = "When I'm not penning YA novels about the impending apocalypse, I work as a freelance content writer specializing in articles about code (I used to be a software engineer), music theory (I also used to be a musician), and off-grid living/digital nomading.\nOn the rare occasion I'm not writing, you can find me swimming, hiking, telling my dog I love her for the bazillionth time today, or watching Taskmaster."
