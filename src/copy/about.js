const about_loki_two = "Our journey began in Santa Cruz, CA. From there, we sailed down the Pacific Coast of the US into Baja California. We spent about a year in Mexico before continuing south through Central America (Guatamala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Hondurus, Costa Rica, and Panama.) In March of 2023 we came through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean."

Readers may recognize her as Malarkey from the Thalassic Series.";
