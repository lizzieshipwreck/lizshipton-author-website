We spent about a year in Mexico before continuing south through Central America (Guatamala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Hondurus, Costa Rica, and Panama.) In March of 2023 we came through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean."

In her maturing years (she is about 5 now) she's calmed down a lot. She is an amazing guard dog and once she gets to know a person, she is ride-or-die.";
